### Hi there üëã

I'm a 22-year-old Ex-Salesforce CRM Project Manager at Klarna turned into Full Stack Web Developer via &lt;/salt&gt;.

Co-founded the Audio Production & Engineering subdivision at Moxie Art Co, an International Brand Strategy & Development company, where we notably won the 'Best Music Video' category in the Los Angeles Film Awards 2019.

In April of 2020, I was selected as one out of 1500 applicants to join </salt>'s Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp alongside 30 other students to pursue my dream of learning web development.

My skills include, but are not limited to: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, React & Redux, Node, Express, Git, REST, Docker, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redux, Continous Integration (CI), Test Driven Development (TDD), REST APIs and agile work methods (SCRUM).
I am also familiar with the Salesforce CRM ecosystem of Custom Objects, Flows, Triggers, Reports & Dashboards, Formula Fields, Lightning Components and more.

If you find my profile interesting, please send me a message over LinkedIn.
I also like meeting new people over a cup of coffee.
